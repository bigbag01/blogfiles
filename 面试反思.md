description: 说是摩根的面试其实是内推的fast check，然而这还是我第一场面试，0准备，全英文，心累累。面试完出来以后发现自己犯了好多错误，同时也感到知识储备的非常不足，所以这篇博客就是关于我仍记得的一些面试中问题的反思。然后又因为受了刺激😃So I decide to write this article in English. Please ignore any grammatical mistakes.

## self introduction

​	What a disaster! With no preparation , I have no idea what to say. After telling him my major and experience in student union, I was stucked so I asked "what else can i say", which seems stupid, and he just said "anything you like". Then I tried to say something about my hobbies and my family.

#### reflection

* **It's important to prepare for your self Introduction！！！**Since it's a common question in interviews.  
* should mention this blog as a good learning habbit
* should say something about my passion in programming 
* should talk more about my social life, friends and family

## technical questions

### part 1

**Q**: Which languages do you use ?

**A**: Java, javascript, C++, python. But I am not familiar with C++ and python, just used them a few times.

**Q**: what's the diffrences between the 4 languages? 

**A**: java supports single inheritance while C++ supports multiple. Java python and js have lots of libraries and frameworks while C++ does not have many, at least not many popular ones. And the STL is not very very good. Java has gabbage collection.

**Q**: Do you know any algorithm used in GC? 

**A**: NO.

**Q**: java does not have pointers, do you think it's an advantage or disadvantage.

**A**: In my experience, i think it's an advantage. Because there would be less stackoverflow problems. It's a useful feature.

#### reflection 

* Should not list all those four languages at the first time. it's more important to master in one than have general understanding for four.

* There are more **Difference** between them

  * C++ and java are the two main programming languages used in morgan stanley, so focus more on them.

    ​	**pointers, multiple inheritance**,(these two are mentioned)**,automatic memory management**(relating to GC) operator overloading,  data type and class, preprocessor, string, goto, type conversion, exception.

* Algorithms in GC

  * reference couting
  * copying
  * mark-and-sweep
  * mark-compact
  * generational collecting
    * minor GC
    * major GC/full GC

### part 2

**Q**: java has many collections , do you know any?

**A**: list,map,set,queue,stack

**Q**: which ones inherites from Collection?

**A**: list, set, queue, stack

**Q**: why is map diffrent?

**A**: maybe because the other four are linear data structures (just my guess).

**Q**: but set is not. so what's map's definition? why do you think it is not  linear structure?

**A**: i don't know. maybe because it stores key value pairs.

**Q**: please write some code to create a map object

**A**:`Map m=new HashMap()`

**Q**: do you know the generics since java5 ?

**A**: I heard about it . with this I can define map like before, or I have to write like this `Map<class,class> m=new HashMap<class,class>()`,or I should change the 'class' here to Object.

**Q**: why should we write like this?

**A**: something about type conversion, I am not sure.

#### reflection

* java collection
  * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html
  * http://blog.csdn.net/u014136713/article/details/52089156
  * the main difference between collection and map is that collection stores a group of objects and map stores key value pairs.
* generics
  * [the goodness of generics](http://blog.csdn.net/sun_abc/article/details/5906765) 

### part 3

**Q**: if i have two objects, how do i know they are same or not?

**A**: compare their address.

**Q**: do you know some function of Object which ……(I forget the question) 

**A**: hashcode()

**Q**: we compare two objects using their hashcode, is there any possiblity that two variable can have same hashcode , for example an int and a String.

**A**: i think there's possibility.

**Q**: then, how to compare ?

**A**: maybe we can compare the class first.

**Q**: you know the function equals(), what's the difference between equals and hashcode ?

**A**: said nothing......feel confused.

#### reflection

* equals and hashcode
  * if 2 objects are the same, the equals method returns true,and the hashcodes of them should be the same.
  * hashcode is used for quick search in hash storage structures
  * if 2 objects have same hashcode ,it doesn't make sure that they are the same object and it doesn't have to appy to the equals method.

### part4

**Q**: I will give you an example, please write some code. We have a class Person, which has attributes of your id, name , age.

**A:**

```java
class Person{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private int age;
}
```

**Q**: you set all the attributes to private, what if i want to get your age?

**A**: add the getter and setter functions.

**Q**: the getter and setter are all public ,what if someone else changes your info? Is that necessary to have setter and getter both?

**A**: em, we can just add getters

**Q**: what if age changes? it's stored in the database and you are 20 this year, the next year the data is still 20.

**A**: maybe we can add a function which changes the age yearly. 

**Q**: but how do you know which date to change?

**A**: we should store the birthdate.

**Q**: change your code and write down the function you use to get age.

```java
class Person{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private Date birthdate;
  public int getAge(){
    Date now=new Date();
    return now.getYear()-this.birthdate.getYear();
  }
}
```

 

#### reflection 

* should have considered age problem at first time.

* not familiar with Date, `java.util.Date().getYear()`method is out of date, it's better to write like this

  ```java
  Calendar ca=Calendar.getInstance();
  int year=ca.get(Calendar.YEAR);
  ```

## my question

**Q**: what's your advice for me in the later studying ?

**A**: you should do more practice, and master the basics ...... (general  meaning)

## conclusion

Actually, my first interview is not that terrible. At least It shows me what a technical interview would be like and it reminds me that there's a long way to go to become someone i want to be.

To be qualified, i would like to spend much more time on java programming. And more articles will be written later.
